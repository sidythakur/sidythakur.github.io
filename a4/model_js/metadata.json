the rabbithole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations": 54, "so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her": 55, "there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear": 56, "i shall be too late": 57, "when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge": 58, "in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again": 59, "the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well": 60, "illustration either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next": 61, "first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs": 62, "she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it": 63, "after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs": 64, "how brave theyll all think me at home": 65, "why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house": 66, "which was very likely true": 67, "would the fall never come to an end": 68, "i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time": 69, "she said aloud": 70, "i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth": 71, "let me see that would be four thousand miles down": 72, "i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to": 73, "alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say": 74, "presently she began again": 75, "i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth": 76, "how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards": 77, "the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know": 78, "please maam is this new zealand or australia": 79, "and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling through the air": 80, "do you think you could manage it": 81, "and what an ignorant little girl shell think me": 82, "no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere": 83, "there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again": 84, "dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think": 85, "dinah was the cat": 86, "i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime": 87, "dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me": 88, "there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know": 89, "but do cats eat bats i wonder": 90, "and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats": 91, "do cats eat bats": 92, "and sometimes do bats eat cats": 93, "for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it": 94, "she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat": 95, "when suddenly thump": 96, "thump": 97, "down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over": 98, "alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it": 99, "there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting": 100, "she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof": 101, "there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again": 102, "suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alices first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas": 103, "either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them": 104, "however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted": 105, "alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw": 106, "how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders": 107, "oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope": 108, "i think i could if i only knew how to begin": 109, "for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible": 110, "there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters": 111, "it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry": 112, "no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later": 113, "however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey coffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off": 114, "what a curious feeling": 115, "i must be shutting up like a telescope": 116, "and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through that little door into that lovely garden": 117, "first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle": 118, "i wonder what i should be like then": 119, "and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing": 120, "after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice": 121, "when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried": 122, "come theres no use in crying like that": 123, "said alice to herself rather sharply": 124, "i advise you to leave off this minute": 125, "she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people": 126, "but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people": 127, "why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person": 128, "soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants": 129, "well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens": 130, "she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way": 131, "which way": 132, "holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way": 133, "so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake": 134, "chapter ii sidenote pool of tears curiouser and curiouser": 135, "cried alice she was so much surprised that for a moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was": 136, "goodbye feet": 137, "for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off": 138, "oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears": 139, "im sure i shant be able": 140, "i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go": 141, "let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas": 142, "and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it": 143, "they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet": 144, "and how odd the directions will look": 145, "alices right foot esq": 146, "hearthrug                   near the fender                       with alices love": 147, "oh dear what nonsense im talking": 148, "just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door": 149, "poor alice": 150, "it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again": 151, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way": 152, "stop this moment i tell you": 153, "but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall": 154, "illustration curiouser and curiouser after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming": 155, "it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh": 156, "the duchess the duchess": 157, "wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting": 158, "alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go": 159, "alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking": 160, "dear dear": 161, "how queer everything is today": 162, "and yesterday things went on just as usual": 163, "i wonder if ive been changed during the night": 164, "let me think was i the same when i got up this morning": 165, "i almost think i can remember feeling a little different": 166, "but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i": 167, "ah thats the great puzzle": 168, "and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them": 169, "im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh": 170, "she knows such a very little": 171, "besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is": 172, "ill try if i know all the things i used to know": 173, "let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear": 174, "i shall never get to twenty at that rate": 175, "however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography": 176, "london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain": 177, "i must have been changed for mabel": 178, "ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do           how doth the little crocodile              improve his shining tail            and pour the waters of the nile              on every golden scale": 179, "how cheerfully he seems to grin              how neatly spreads his claws            and welcomes little fishes in              with gently smiling jaws": 180, "im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on": 181, "i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh": 182, "ever so many lessons to learn": 183, "no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here": 184, "itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear": 185, "i shall only look up and say who am i then": 186, "tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear": 187, "cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down": 188, "i am so very tired of being all alone here": 189, "as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking": 190, "how can i have done that": 191, "i must be growing small again": 192, "she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether": 193, "that was a narrow escape": 194, "said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden": 195, "and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas": 196, "the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never": 197, "and i declare its too bad that it is": 198, "as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash": 199, "she was up to her chin in salt water": 200, "her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself": 201, "alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station": 202, "however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high": 203, "i wish i hadnt cried so much": 204, "said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out": 205, "i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears": 206, "that will be a queer thing to be sure": 207, "however everything is queer today": 208, "just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself": 209, "would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse": 210, "everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying": 211, "so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool": 212, "i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse": 213, "alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse": 214, "the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing": 215, "perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror": 216, "for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened": 217, "so she began again o\u00f9 est ma chatte": 218, "which was the first sentence in her french lessonbook": 219, "the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright": 220, "cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings": 221, "i quite forgot you didnt like cats": 222, "not like cats": 223, "cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice": 224, "would you like cats if you were me": 225, "well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it": 226, "and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her": 227, "she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon": 228, "cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended": 229, "we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not": 230, "we indeed": 231, "cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail": 232, "as if i would talk on such a subject": 233, "our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things": 234, "dont let me hear the name again": 235, "illustration the pool of tears i wont indeed": 236, "said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation": 237, "are youare you fondofof dogs": 238, "the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you": 239, "a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair": 240, "and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds": 241, "he says it kills all the rats andoh dear": 242, "cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again": 243, "for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went": 244, "so she called softly after it mouse dear": 245, "do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them": 246, "when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs": 247, "it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures": 248, "alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore": 249, "chapter iii sidenote a caucusrace and a long tale they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable": 250, "the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life": 251, "indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said": 252, "at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me": 253, "ill soon make you dry enough": 254, "they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle": 255, "alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon": 256, "ahem": 257, "said the mouse with an important air": 258, "are you all ready": 259, "this is the driest thing i know": 260, "silence all round if you please": 261, "william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest": 262, "edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh": 263, "said the lory with a shiver": 264, "i beg your pardon": 265, "said the mouse frowning but very politely": 266, "did you speak": 267, "said the lory hastily": 268, "i thought you did said the mouse i proceed": 269, "edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable found what": 270, "said the duck": 271, "found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means": 272, "i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm": 273, "the question is what did the archbishop find": 274, "the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown": 275, "williams conduct at first was moderate": 276, "but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear": 277, "it continued turning to alice as it spoke": 278, "as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone doesnt seem to dry me at all": 279, "in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english": 280, "said the eaglet": 281, "i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either": 282, "and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly": 283, "what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace": 284, "what is a caucusrace": 285, "said alice not that she much wanted to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything": 286, "why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it": 287, "and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it": 288, "first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there": 289, "there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over": 290, "however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called the race is over": 291, "and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won": 292, "this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence": 293, "at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes": 294, "but who is to give the prizes": 295, "quite a chorus of voices asked": 296, "why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes": 297, "prizes": 298, "alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes": 299, "there was exactly one apiece all round": 300, "they all crowded round it panting and asking           but who has won": 301, " illustration but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse": 302, "of course the dodo replied very gravely": 303, "what else have you got in your pocket": 304, "it went on turning to alice": 305, "only a thimble said alice sadly": 306, "hand it over here said the dodo": 307, "then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered": 308, "alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so

people about like that": 387, "by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass": 388, "there was no label this time with the

enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much": 393, "alas": 394, "it was too late to wish that": 395, "she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head": 396, "still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens": 397, "what will become of me": 398, "luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy": 399, "it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits": 400, "i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life": 401, "i do wonder what can have happened to me": 402, "when i used to

comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn": 407, "oh i shouldnt like that": 408, "oh you foolish alice": 409, "she answered herself": 410, "how can you learn lessons in here": 411, "why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks": 412, "and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen": 413, "said the voice": 414, "fetch me my gloves this moment": 415, "then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs": 416, "alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it": 417, "presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure": 418, "alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window": 419, "that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air": 420, "she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort": 421, "next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat": 422, "pat": 423, "where are you": 424, "and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here": 425, "digging for apples yer honour": 426, "digging for apples indeed": 427, "said the rabbit angrily": 428, "come and help me out of this": 429,

size": 435, "why it fills the whole window": 436, "sure it does yer honour": 437, "but its an arm for all that": 438, "well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away": 439, "there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all": 440, "do as i tell you you coward": 441, "and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air": 442, "this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass": 443, "what a number of cucumberframes there must be": 444, "i wonder what theyll do next": 445, "as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could": 446, "im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer": 447, "she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill": 448, "fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh": 449, "theyll do well enough dont be particularhere bill": 450, "catch

do itthat i wont then": 454, "bills to go downhere bill": 455, "the master says youve to go down the chimney": 456, "so bills got to come down the chimney has he": 457, "said alice to herself": 458, "why they seem to put everything upon bill": 459, "i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little": 460, "she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next": 461, "the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill": 462, "then the rabbits voice alonecatch him you by the hedge": 463, "then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow": 464, "what happened to you": 465, "tell us all about it": 466, "at last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket": 467, "so you did old fellow": 468, "said the others": 469, "we must burn the house down": 470, "said the rabbits voice": 471, "and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you": 472, "there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next": 473, "if they had any sense theyd take the roof off": 474, "after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with": 475, "a barrowful of what": 476, "but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face": 477, "ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again": 478, "which produced another dead silence": 479, "alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head": 480, "if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose": 481, "so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly": 482, "as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside": 483, "the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle": 484, "they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood": 485, "the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden": 486, "i think that will be the best plan": 487, "it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry": 488, "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her": 489, "poor little thing": 490, "said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing": 491, "hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut": 492, "this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance": 493, "and yet what a dear little puppy it was": 494, "said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves": 495, "i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it": 496, "id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again": 497, "let me seehow is it to be managed": 498, "i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what": 499, "the great question certainly was what": 500, "alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances": 501, "there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it": 502, "she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else": 503, "chapter v sidenote advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice": 504, "this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation": 505, "alice replied rather shyly i hardly know sir just at presentat least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then": 506, "what do you mean by that": 507, "said the caterpillar sternly": 508, "explain yourself": 509, "i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see": 510, "i dont see said the caterpillar": 511, "im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing": 512, "it isnt said the caterpillar": 513, "well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you": 514, "not a bit said the caterpillar": 515, "well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me": 516, "you": 517, "said the caterpillar contemptuously": 518, "which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation": 519, "alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first": 520, "illustration advice from a caterpillar here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away": 521, "come back": 522, "the caterpillar called after her": 523, "ive something important to say": 524, "this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again": 525, "keep your temper said the caterpillar": 526, "is that all": 527, "said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could": 528, "no said the caterpillar": 529, "alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing": 530, "for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you": 531, "im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together": 532, "cant remember what things": 533, "well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different": 534, "alice replied in a very melancholy voice": 535, "repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar": 536, "alice folded her hands and began           you are old father william the young man said             and your hair has become very white           and yet you incessantly stand on your head             do you think at your age it is right": 537, "in my youth father william replied to his son             i feared it might injure the brain           but now that im perfectly sure i have none             why i do it again and again": 538, "you are old said the youth as i mentioned before             and have grown most uncommonly fat           yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door             pray what is the reason of that": 539, "in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks             i kept all my limbs very supple           by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box             allow me to sell you a couple": 540, "you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak             for anything tougher than suet           yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak             pray how did you manage to do it": 541, "in my youth said his father i took to the law             and argued each case with my wife           and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw             has lasted the rest of my life": 542, "you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose             that your eye was as steady as ever           yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose             what made you so awfully clever": 543, "i have answered three questions and that is enough             said his father dont give yourself airs": 544, "do you think i can listen all day to such stuff": 545, "be off or ill kick you down stairs": 546, "that is not said right said the caterpillar": 547, "not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered": 548, "it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes": 549, "the caterpillar was the first to speak": 550, "what size do you want to be": 551, "it asked": 552, "oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know": 553, "i dont know said the caterpillar": 554, "alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in all her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper": 555, "are you content now": 556, "well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be": 557, "it is a very good height indeed": 558, "said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high": 559, "but im not used to it": 560, "pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone": 561, "and she thought to herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended": 562, "youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put its hookah into its mouth and began smoking again": 563, "this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again": 564, "in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself": 565, "then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter": 566, "one side of what": 567, "the other side of what": 568, "of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight": 569, "alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question": 570, "however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand": 571, "and now which is which": 572, "she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot": 573, "illustration she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit": 574, "her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit": 575, "come my heads free at last": 576, "said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her": 577, "what can all that green stuff be": 578, "and where have my shoulders got to": 579, "and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you": 580, "she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves": 581, "as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent": 582, "she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings": 583, "serpent": 584, "screamed the pigeon": 585, "im not a serpent": 586, "let me alone": 587, "serpent i say again": 588, "repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of a sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them": 589, "i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice": 590, "ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents": 591, "theres no pleasing them": 592, "alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished": 593, "as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day": 594, "why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks": 595, "im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning": 596, "illustration and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky": 597, "ugh serpent": 598, "but im not a serpent i tell you": 599, "im a im a  well": 600, "what are you": 601, "said the pigeon": 602, "i can see youre trying to invent something": 603, "iim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day": 604, "a likely story indeed": 605, "said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt": 606, "ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that": 607, "youre a serpent and theres no use denying it": 608, "i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg": 609, "i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know": 610, "i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say": 611, "this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent": 612, "it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them raw": 613, "well be off then": 614, "said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest": 615, "alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it": 616, "after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height": 617, "it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual": 618, "come theres half my plan done now": 619, "how puzzling all these changes are": 620, "im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another": 621, "however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder": 622, "as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high": 623, "whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits": 624, "so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high": 625, "chapter vi sidenote pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles": 626, "it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads": 627, "she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen": 628, "the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess": 629, "an invitation from the queen to play croquet": 630, "the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen": 631, "an invitation for the duchess to play croquet": 632, "then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together": 633, "alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky": 634, "alice went timidly up to the door and knocked": 635, "theres no use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons": 636, "first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you": 637, "and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces": 638, "please then said alice how am i to get in": 639, "there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us": 640, "for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know": 641, "he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil": 642, "but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head": 643, "but at any rate he might answer questions": 644, "she repeated aloud": 645, "i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him ": 646, "or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened": 647, "asked alice again in a louder tone": 648, "are you to get in at all": 649, "said the footman": 650, "thats the first question you know": 651, "illustration it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so": 652, "its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue": 653, "its enough to drive one crazy": 654, "the footman seemed to consider this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations": 655, "i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days": 656, "but what am i to do": 657, "anything you like said the footman and began whistling": 658, "oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic": 659, "and she opened the door and went in": 660, "the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup": 661, "theres certainly too much pepper in that soup": 662, "alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing": 663, "there was certainly too much of it in the air": 664, "even the duchess sneezed occasionally and the baby was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause": 665, "the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear": 666, "please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that": 667, "its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why": 668, "pig": 669, "she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin": 670, "they all can said the duchess and most of em do": 671, "i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation": 672, "you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact": 673, "alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation": 674, "while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes": 675, "the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not": 676, "oh please mind what youre doing": 677, "cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror": 678, "oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off": 679, "if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does": 680, "illustration an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge": 681, "just think what work it would make with the day and night": 682, "you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head": 683, "alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily engaged in stirring the soup and did not seem to be listening so she ventured to go on again twentyfour hours i think or is it twelve": 684, "i oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures": 685, "and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line           speak roughly to your little boy             and beat him when he sneezes           he only does it to annoy             because he knows it teases": 686, "chorus           in which the cook and the baby joined           wow": 687, "while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words           i speak severely to my boy             i beat him when he sneezes           for he can thoroughly enjoy             the pepper when he pleases": 688, "chorus": 689, "you may nurse it a bit if you like": 690, "the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke": 691, "i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room": 692, "the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her": 693, "alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice": 694, "the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it": 695, "as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air": 696, "if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind": 697, "she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time": 698, "dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself": 699, "the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it": 700, "there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all": 701, "but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears": 702, "no there were no tears": 703, "if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you": 704, "mind now": 705, "the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence": 706, "alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home": 707, "when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm": 708, "this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further": 709, "so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot quietly away into the wood": 710, "if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think": 711, "and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off": 712, "illustration it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm the cat only grinned when it saw alice": 713, "it looked goodnatured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect": 714, "illustration cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider": 715, "come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on": 716, "would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here": 717, "that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat": 718, "i dont much care where said alice": 719, "then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat ": 720, " so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation": 721, "oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough": 722, "alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question": 723, "what sort of people live about here": 724, "in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare": 725, "visit either you like theyre both mad": 726, "but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked": 727, "oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here": 728, "im mad": 729, "youre mad": 730, "how do you know im mad": 731, "you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here": 732, "alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on": 733, "and how do you know that youre mad": 734, "to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad": 735, "you grant that": 736, "i suppose so said alice": 737, "well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased": 738, "now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry": 739, "therefore im mad": 740, "i call it purring not growling said alice": 741, "call it what you like said the cat": 742, "do you play croquet with the queen today": 743, "i should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet": 744, "youll see me there said the cat and vanished": 745, "alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening": 746, "while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again": 747, "bythebye what became of the baby": 748, "id nearly forgotten to ask": 749, "it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way": 750, "i thought it would said the cat and vanished again": 751, "alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live": 752, "ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in march": 753, "as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on the branch of a tree": 754, "did you say pig or fig": 755, "i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy": 756, "all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone": 757, "ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat": 758, "its the most curious thing i ever saw in all my life": 759, "illustration she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur": 760, "it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all": 761, "i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead": 762, "chapter vii sidenote a mad teaparty there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head": 763, "very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep suppose it doesnt mind": 764, "the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it": 765, "they cried out when they saw alice coming": 766, "theres plenty of room": 767, "said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table": 768, "have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone": 769, "alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea": 770, "i dont see any wine she remarked": 771, "there isnt any said the march hare": 772, "then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily": 773, "it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare": 774, "i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three": 775, "your hair wants cutting said the hatter": 776, "he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech": 777, "you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude": 778, "the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk": 779, "come we shall have some fun now": 780, "im glad theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud": 781, "do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it": 782, "exactly so said alice": 783, "then you should say what you mean the march hare went on": 784, "i do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you know": 785, "not the same thing a bit": 786, "why you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see": 787, "you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like": 788, "you might just as well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe": 789, "it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt much": 790, "illustration a mad tea party the hatter was the first to break the silence": 791, "what day of the month is it": 792, "he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear": 793, "alice considered a little and then said the fourth": 794, "two days wrong": 795, "sighed the hatter": 796, "i told you butter would not suit the works": 797, "he added looking angrily at the march hare": 798, "it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied": 799, "yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife": 800, "the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know": 801, "alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity": 802, "what a funny watch": 803, "she remarked": 804, "it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is": 805, "why should it": 806, "muttered the hatter": 807, "does your watch tell you what year it is": 808, "of course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together": 809, "which is just the case with mine said the hatter": 810, "alice felt dreadfully puzzled": 811, "the hatters remark seemed to have no meaning in it and yet it was certainly english": 812, "i dont quite understand she said as politely as she could": 813, "the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose": 814, "the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself": 815, "have you guessed the riddle yet": 816, "the hatter said turning to alice again": 817, "no i give it up alice replied whats the answer": 818, "i havent the slightest idea said the hatter": 819, "nor i said the march hare": 820, "alice sighed wearily": 821, "i think you might do something better with the time she said than wasting it asking riddles with no answers": 822, "if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it": 823, "its him": 824, "i dont know what you mean said alice": 825, "of course you dont": 826, "the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously": 827, "i daresay you never spoke to time": 828, "perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music": 829, "that accounts for it said the hatter": 830, "he wont stand beating": 831, "now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock": 832, "for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling": 833, "halfpast one time for dinner": 834, "i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper": 835, "that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know": 836, "not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked": 837, "is that the way you manage": 838, "the hatter shook his head mournfully": 839, "he replied": 840, "we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his teaspoon to the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing           twinkle twinkle little bat": 841, "how i wonder what youre at": 842, "you know that song perhaps": 843, "ive heard something like it said alice": 844, "it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way           up above the world you fly           like a teatray in the sky": 845, "twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop": 846, "well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time": 847, "how dreadfully savage": 848, "and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask": 849, "its always six oclock now": 850, "a bright idea came into alices head": 851, "is that the reason so many teathings are put out here": 852, "she asked": 853, "yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles": 854, "then you keep moving round i suppose": 855, "exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up": 856, "but what happens when you come to the beginning again": 857, "alice ventured to ask": 858, "suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning": 859, "im getting tired of this": 860, "i vote the young lady tells us a story": 861, "im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal": 862, "then the dormouse shall": 863, "they both cried": 864, "wake up dormouse": 865, "and they pinched it on both sides at once": 866, "the dormouse slowly opened his eyes": 867, "i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying": 868, "tell us a story": 869, "yes please do": 870, "pleaded alice": 871, "and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done": 872, "once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on": 873, "said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking": 874, "they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two": 875, "they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well": 876, "take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly": 877, "ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more": 878, "you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing": 879, "nobody asked your opinion said alice": 880, "whos making personal remarks now": 881, "the hatter asked triumphantly": 882, "alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question": 883, "why did they live at the bottom of a well": 884, "the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treaclewell": 885, "theres no such thing": 886, "alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh": 887, "sh": 888, "and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself": 889, "no please go on": 890, "alice said very humbly": 891, "i wont interrupt you again": 892, "i dare say there may be one": 893, "one indeed": 894, "said the dormouse indignantly": 895, "however he consented to go on": 896, "and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know what did they draw": 897, "said alice quite forgetting her promise": 898, "treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time": 899, "i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place on": 900, "he moved as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare": 901, "the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate": 902, "alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i dont understand": 903, "where did they draw the treacle from": 904, "you can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid": 905, "but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark": 906, "of course they were said the dormouse well in": 907, "this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it": 908, "they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m why with an m": 909, "why not": 910, "alice was silent": 911, "the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a dose but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness": 912, "really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think then you shouldnt talk said the hatter": 913, "this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot": 914, "at any rate ill never go there again": 915, "said alice as she picked her way through the wood": 916, "its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my life": 917, "just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it": 918, "thats very curious": 919, "but everythings curious today": 920, "i think i may as well go in at once": 921, "and in she went": 922, "once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table": 923, "now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden": 924, "then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains": 925, "chapter viii sidenote the queens croquetground a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red": 926, "alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five": 927, "dont go splashing paint over me like that": 928, "i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone": 929, "seven jogged my elbow": 930, "on which seven looked up and said thats right five": 931, "always lay the blame on others": 932, "youd better not talk": 933, "i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded": 934, "said the one who had first spoken": 935, "thats none of your business two": 936, "said seven": 937, "yes it is his business": 938, "and ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions": 939, "seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low": 940, "would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses": 941, "five and seven said nothing but looked at two": 942, "two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know": 943, "so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen": 944, "the queen": 945, "and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces": 946, "there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen": 947, "first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did": 948, "after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts": 949, "next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her": 950, "then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts": 951, "alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it": 952, "so she stood still where she was and waited": 953, "when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this": 954, "she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply": 955, "idiot": 956, "said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name child": 957, "my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all": 958, "i neednt be afraid of them": 959, "and who are these": 960, "said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children": 961, "how should i know": 962, "said alice surprised at her own courage": 963, "its no business of mine": 964, "the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head": 965, "off nonsense": 966, "said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent": 967, "the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child": 968, "the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over": 969, "the knave did so very carefully with one foot": 970, "get up": 971, "said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else": 972, "leave off that": 973, "screamed the queen": 974, "you make me giddy": 975, "and then turning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing here": 976, "may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying illustration the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over i see": 977, "said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses": 978, "off with their heads": 979, "and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection": 980, "you shant be beheaded": 981, "said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near": 982, "the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others": 983, "are their heads off": 984, "their heads are gone if it please your majesty": 985, "the soldiers shouted in reply": 986, "thats right": 987, "can you play croquet": 988, "the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her": 989, "yes": 990, "shouted alice": 991, "come on then": 992, "roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next": 993, "itsits a very fine day": 994, "said a timid voice at her side": 995, "she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face": 996, "very said alice wheres the duchess": 997, "said the rabbit in a low hurried tone": 998, "he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution": 999, "did you say what a pity": 1000, "the rabbit asked": 1001, "no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity": 1002, "i said what for": 1003, "she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began": 1004, "alice gave a little scream of laughter": 1005, "oh hush": 1006, "the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone": 1007, "the queen will hear you": 1008, "you see she came rather late and the queen said get to your places": 1009, "shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began": 1010, "alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in all her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand upon their hands and feet to make the arches": 1011, "illustration the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed": 1012, "the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head": 1013, "about once in a minute": 1014, "alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me": 1015, "theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive": 1016, "she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to": 1017, "how are you getting on": 1018, "said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with": 1019, "alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded": 1020, "its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them": 1021, "in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had some one to listen to her": 1022, "the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared": 1023, "i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming": 1024, "illustration how do you like the queen": 1025, "said the cat in a low voice": 1026, "not at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game": 1027, "the queen smiled and passed on": 1028, "who are you talking to": 1029, "said the king coming up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity": 1030, "its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it": 1031, "i dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes": 1032, "id rather not the cat remarked": 1033, "dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that": 1034, "he got behind alice as he spoke": 1035, "a cat may look at a king said alice": 1036, "ive read that in some book but i dont remember where": 1037, "well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called to the queen who was passing at the moment my dear": 1038, "i wish you would have this cat removed": 1039, "the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small": 1040, "she said without even looking round": 1041, "ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off": 1042, "alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion": 1043, "she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not": 1044, "so she went in search of her hedgehog": 1045, "the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into one of the trees": 1046, "by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground": 1047, "so she tucked it under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend": 1048, "when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable": 1049, "the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said": 1050, "illustration the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life": 1051, "the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense": 1052, "the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round": 1053, "it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious": 1054, "alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it": 1055, "shes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here": 1056, "and the executioner went off like an arrow": 1057, "the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game": 1058, "chapter ix sidenote the mock turtles story you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing": 1059, "said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together": 1060, "alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen": 1061, "when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all": 1062, "soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandbarleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered": 1063, "i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear": 1064, "youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk": 1065, "i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit": 1066, "perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark": 1067, "tut tut child": 1068, "every things got a moral if only you can find it": 1069, "and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke": 1070, "alice did not much like her keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin on alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin": 1071, "however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could": 1072, "the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little": 1073, "tis so said the duchess and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that makes the world go round": 1074, "somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business": 1075, "ah well": 1076, "it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves": 1077, "how fond she is of finding morals in things": 1078, "alice thought to herself": 1079, "i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo": 1080, "shall i try the experiment": 1081, "he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried": 1082, "very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite": 1083, "and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock together": 1084, "only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked": 1085, "right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things": 1086, "its a mineral i think said alice": 1087, "of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near here": 1088, "and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours": 1089, "oh i know": 1090, "exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark": 1091, "its a vegetable": 1092, "it doesnt look like one but it is": 1093, "i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise": 1094, "i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it": 1095, "thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone": 1096, "pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice": 1097, "oh dont talk about trouble": 1098, "i make you a present of everything ive said as yet": 1099, "a cheap sort of present": 1100, "im glad they dont give birthday presents like that": 1101, "but she did not venture to say it out loud": 1102, "thinking again": 1103, "the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin": 1104, "ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried": 1105, "just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble": 1106, "alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm": 1107, "a fine day your majesty": 1108, "the duchess began in a low weak voice": 1109, "now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time": 1110, "take your choice": 1111, "the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment": 1112, "lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground": 1113, "the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives": 1114, "illustration the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head": 1115, " all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head": 1116, "those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution": 1117, "then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet": 1118, "no said alice": 1119, "i dont even know what a mock turtle is": 1120, "its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen": 1121, "i never saw one or heard of one said alice": 1122, "come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history": 1123, "as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned": 1124, "come thats a good thing": 1125, "she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered": 1126, "they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun": 1127, "if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture": 1128, "up lazy thing": 1129, "said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history": 1130, "i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon": 1131, "alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited": 1132, "the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled": 1133, "what fun": 1134, "said the gryphon half to itself half to alice": 1135, "what is the fun": 1136, "why she said the gryphon": 1137, "its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know": 1138, "everybody says come on": 1139, "here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in my life never": 1140, "illustration they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break": 1141, "she pitied him deeply": 1142, "what is his sorrow": 1143, "she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know": 1144, "so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing": 1145, "this here young lady said the gryphon she wants to know your history she do": 1146, "ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished": 1147, "so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes": 1148, "alice thought to herself i dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin": 1149, "but she waited patiently": 1150, "once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle": 1151, "these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh": 1152, "from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle": 1153, "alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing": 1154, "when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea": 1155, "the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one": 1156, "we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull": 1157, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth": 1158, "at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow": 1159, "dont be all day about it": 1160, "and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it i never said i didnt": 1161, "interrupted alice": 1162, "you did said the mock turtle": 1163, "added the gryphon before alice could speak again": 1164, "the mock turtle went on we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day ive been to a dayschool too said alice you neednt be so proud as all that": 1165, "with extras": 1166, "asked the mock turtle a little anxiously": 1167, "yes said alice we learned french and music": 1168, "and washing": 1169, "certainly not": 1170, "then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of relief": 1171, "now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washingextra": 1172, "you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea": 1173, "i couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh": 1174, "i only took the regular course": 1175, "what was that": 1176, "inquired alice": 1177, "reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmeticambition distraction uglification and derision": 1178, "i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say": 1179, "what is it": 1180, "the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise": 1181, "never heard of uglifying": 1182, "it exclaimed": 1183, "you know what to beautify is i suppose": 1184, "yes said alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier": 1185, "well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton": 1186, "alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn": 1187, "well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils": 1188, "what was that like": 1189, "well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff": 1190, "and the gryphon never learnt it": 1191, "hadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classical master though": 1192, "he was an old crab he was": 1193, "i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say": 1194, "so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws": 1195, "and how many hours a day did you do lessons": 1196, "said alice in a hurry to change the subject": 1197, "ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on": 1198, "what a curious plan": 1199, "thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day": 1200, "this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought over it a little before she made her next remark": 1201, "then the eleventh day must have been a holiday": 1202, "of course it was said the mock turtle": 1203, "and how did you manage on the twelfth": 1204, "alice went on eagerly": 1205, "thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now": 1206, "chapter x sidenote the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes": 1207, "he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice": 1208, "same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back": 1209, "at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks went on again you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is": 1210, "no indeed said alice": 1211, "what sort of a dance is it": 1212, "why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the seashore two lines": 1213, "cried the mock turtle": 1214, "seals turtles and so on then when youve cleared the jellyfish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon ": 1215, "you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner": 1216, "cried the gryphon": 1217, "of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon": 1218, "then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters": 1219, "shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air ": 1220, "as far out to sea as you can swim after them": 1221, "screamed the gryphon": 1222, "turn a somersault in the sea": 1223, "cried the mock turtle capering wildly about": 1224, "change lobsters again": 1225, "yelled the gryphon": 1226, "back to land again andthats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice": 1227, "it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly": 1228, "would you like to see a little of it": 1229, "very much indeed said alice": 1230, "come lets try the first figure": 1231, "said the mock turtle to the gryphon": 1232, "we can do it without lobsters you know": 1233, "which shall sing": 1234, "oh you sing said the gryphon": 1235, "ive forgotten the words": 1236, "so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly   will you walk a little faster": 1237, "said a whiting to a snail   theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail": 1238, "see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance": 1239, "they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance": 1240, "you can really have no notion how delightful it will be   when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea": 1241, "but the snail replied too far too far": 1242, "and gave a look askance   said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance": 1243, "would not could not would not could not would not join the dance": 1244, "would not could not would not could not could not join the dance": 1245, "what matters it how far we go": 1246, "his scaly friend replied   there is another shore you know upon the other side": 1247, "the further off from england the nearer is to france   then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance": 1248, "thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting": 1249, "oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them of course": 1250, "yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily": 1251, "i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like": 1252, "i believe so alice replied thoughtfully": 1253, "they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs": 1254, "youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea": 1255, "but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes": 1256, "tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon": 1257, "the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance": 1258, "so they got thrown out to sea": 1259, "so they had to fall a long way": 1260, "so they got their tails fast in their mouths": 1261, "so they couldnt get them out again": 1262, "thats all": 1263, "thank you said alice": 1264, "its very interesting": 1265, "i never knew so much about a whiting before": 1266, "i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon": 1267, "do you know why its called a whiting": 1268, "i never thought about it said alice": 1269, "it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly": 1270, "alice was thoroughly puzzled": 1271, "does the boots and shoes": 1272, "she repeated in a wondering tone": 1273, "why what are your shoes done with": 1274, "said the gryphon": 1275, "i mean what makes them so shiny": 1276, "alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer": 1277, "theyre done with blacking i believe": 1278, "boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with whiting": 1279, "now you know": 1280, "and what are they made of": 1281, "alice asked in a tone of great curiosity": 1282, "soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that": 1283, "if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us": 1284, "they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise": 1285, "wouldnt it really": 1286, "said alice in a tone of great surprise": 1287, "of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise": 1288, "dont you mean purpose": 1289, "i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone": 1290, "and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventures": 1291, "illustration the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious i could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then": 1292, "explain all that said the mock turtle": 1293, "the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time": 1294, "so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit": 1295, "she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on": 1296, "her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious": 1297, "its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon": 1298, "it all came different": 1299, "the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully": 1300, "i should like to hear her repeat something now": 1301, "tell her to begin": 1302, "he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice": 1303, "stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon": 1304, "how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons": 1305, "i might as well be at school at once": 1306, "however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed           tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare           you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair": 1307, "as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose           trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes": 1308, "when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark           and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark           but when the tide rises and sharks are around           his voice has a timid and tremulous sound": 1309, "thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon": 1310, "well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense": 1311, "alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again": 1312, "i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle": 1313, "she cant explain it hastily said the gryphon": 1314, "go on with the next verse": 1315, "but about his toes": 1316, "the mock turtle persisted": 1317, "how could he turn them out with his nose you know": 1318, "its the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject": 1319, "go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated it begins i passed by his garden": 1320, "alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice           i passed by his garden and marked with one eye           how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie           the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat           while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat": 1321, "when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon           was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon           while the panther received knife and fork with a growl           and concluded the banquet by what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on": 1322, "its by far the most confusing thing i ever heard": 1323, "illustration yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so": 1324, "shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille": 1325, "the gryphon went on": 1326, "or would you like the mock turtle to sing you another song": 1327, "oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm": 1328, "no accounting for tastes": 1329, "sing her turtle soup will you old fellow": 1330, "the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice choked with sobs to sing this           beautiful soup so rich and green           waiting in a hot tureen": 1331, "who for such dainties would not stoop": 1332, "beautiful soup": 1333, "who cares for fish           game or any other dish": 1334, "who would not give all else for two           pennyworth only of beautiful soup": 1335, "pennyworth only of beautiful soup": 1336, "chorus again": 1337, "cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning": 1338, "was heard in the distance": 1339, "cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song": 1340, "what trial is it": 1341, "alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on": 1342, "and ran the faster while more and more faintly came

queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other": 1344, "in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments": 1345, "but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking about her to pass away the time": 1346, "alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there": 1347, "thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig": 1348, "the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming": 1349, "and thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors": 1350, "she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all": 1351, "however jurymen would have done just as well": 1352, "the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates": 1353, "what are they all doing": 1354, "alice whispered to the gryphon": 1355, "they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun": 1356,

began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court": 1359, "and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to see who was talking": 1360, "alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things": 1361, "on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him": 1362, "a nice muddle their slates will be in before the trials over": 1363, "one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked": 1364, "this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away": 1365, "she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate": 1366, "herald read the accusation": 1367, "on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and

encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter": 1391,

and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her": 1392, "i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her":

youre growing too": 1397, "yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion": 1398, "and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court":

last concert": 1400, "on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook off both his shoes": 1401, "give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not": 1402, "im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea

hard word i will just explain to you how it was done": 1423, "they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it":

dear you must crossexamine the next witness": 1453, "it quite makes my forehead ache": 1454, "alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself": 1455, "imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice":

that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before": 1458, "she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die": 1459, "the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so": 1460, "alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move": 1461, "she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other": 1462, "as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court": 1463, "what do you know about this business": 1464, "the king said to alice": 1465, "nothing said alice": 1466, "nothing

from him to you              though they were mine before": 1513, "if i or she should chance to be              involved in this affair            he trusts to you to set them free              exactly as we were": 1514, "my notion was that you had been              before she had this fit            an obstacle that came between              him and ourselves and it": 1515, "dont let him know she liked them best              for this must ever be            a secret kept from all the rest              between yourself and me": 1516, "thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence": 1517, "i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it": 1518, "the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper": 1519, "if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any": 1520, "and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all ": 1521, "said i could not swim you cant swim can you": 1522, "he added turning to the knave": 1523, "the knave shook his head sadly": 1524, "do i look like it": 1525, "he said": 1526, "which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard": 1527, "all right so far said the king as he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of courseif she should push the matter onthat must be the queenwhat would become of youwhat indeedi gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice": 1528, "why there they are": 1529, "said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table": 1530, "nothing can be clearer than that": 1531, "then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think": 1532, "he said to the queen": 1533, "never": 1534, "said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke": 1535, "the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted": 1536, "then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile": 1537, "there was a dead silence": 1538, "its a pun": 1539, "the king added in an angry tone and everybody laughed": 1540, "let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day": 1541, "sentence firstverdict afterwards": 1542, "stuff and nonsense": 1543, "said alice loudly": 1544, "the idea of having the sentence first": 1545, "said the queen turning purple": 1546, "i wont": 1547, "off with her head": 1548, "the queen shouted at the top of her voice": 1549, "nobody moved": 1550, "who cares for you": 1551, "said alice she had grown to her full size by this time": 1552, "youre nothing but a pack of cards": 1553, "illustration at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face": 1554, "wake up alice dear": 1555, "said her sister": 1556, "why what a long sleep youve had": 1557, "oh ive had such a curious dream": 1558, "said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late": 1559, "so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been": 1560, "but her sister sat still just as she had left her leaning her head watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream": 1561, "the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchess knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle": 1562, "so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to the tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs": 1563, "lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days": 1564, "                                                                     page jonathan harkers journal

far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible": 1568, "the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish rule": 1569, "we left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburgh": 1570, "here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale": 1571, "i had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty": 1572, "mem get recipe for mina": 1573, "i asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians": 1574, "i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed i dont know how i should be able to get on without it": 1575, "having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country": 1576, "i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe": 1577, "i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the post town named by count dracula is a fairly wellknown place": 1578, "i shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina": 1579, "in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are the descendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in the east and north": 1580, "i am going among the latter who claim to be descended from attila and the huns": 1581, "this may be so for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it": 1582, "i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting": 1583, "mem i must ask the count all about them": 1584, "i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had all sorts of queer dreams": 1585, "there was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty": 1586, "towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then": 1587, "i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata": 1588, "mem get recipe for this also": 1589, "i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at 730 i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move": 1590, "it seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains": 1591, "what ought they to be in china": 1592, "all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind": 1593, "sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods": 1594, "it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear": 1595, "at every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire": 1596, "some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque": 1597, "the women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist": 1598, "they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under them": 1599, "the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass nails": 1600, "they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches": 1601, "they are very picturesque but do not look prepossessing": 1602, "on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands": 1603, "they are however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural selfassertion": 1604, "it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a very interesting old place": 1605, "being practically on the frontierfor the borgo pass leads from it into bukovinait has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it": 1606, "fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions": 1607, "at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13000 people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease": 1608, "count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i found to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country": 1609, "i was evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhite undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty": 1610, "when i came close she bowed and said the herr englishman": 1611, "yes i said jonathan harker": 1612, "she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves who had followed her to the door": 1613, "he went but immediately returned with a letter      my friendwelcome to the carpathians": 1614, "i am anxiously expecting      you": 1615, "sleep well tonight": 1616, "at three tomorrow the diligence will      start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you": 1617, "at the borgo      pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me": 1618, "i trust      that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land": 1619, "your friend dracula": 1620, "4 mayi found that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german": 1621, "this could not be true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did": 1622, "he and his wife the old lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of way": 1623, "he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew": 1624, "when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further": 1625, "it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting": 1626, "just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way must you go": 1627, "young herr must you go": 1628, "she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all": 1629, "i was just able to follow her by asking many questions": 1630, "when i told her that i must go at once and that i was engaged on important business she asked again do you know what day it is": 1631, "i answered that it was the fourth of may": 1632, "she shook her head as she said again oh yes": 1633, "i know that": 1634, "i know that but do you know what day it is": 1635, "on my saying that i did not understand she went on it is the eve of st georges day": 1636, "do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway": 1637, "do you know where you are going and what you are going to": 1638, "she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but without effect": 1639, "finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting": 1640, "it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable": 1641, "however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it": 1642, "i therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked her but my duty was imperative and that i must go": 1643, "she then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me": 1644, "i did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind": 1645, "she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mothers sake and went out of the room": 1646, "i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still round my neck": 1647, "whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual": 1648, "if this book should ever reach mina before i do let it bring my goodbye": 1649, "here comes the coach": 1650, "5 may": 1651, "the castlethe grey of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed": 1652, "i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake naturally i write till sleep comes": 1653, "there are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly": 1654, "i dined on what they called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the london cats meat": 1655, "the wine was golden mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable": 1656, "i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else": 1657, "when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him talking with the landlady": 1658, "they were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly": 1659, "i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out": 1660, "i must say they were not cheering to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhell stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same thing one being slovak and the other servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire": 1661, "mem i must ask the count about these superstitions when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me": 1662, "with some difficulty i got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye": 1663, "this was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but be touched": 1664, "i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard": 1665, "then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey": 1666, "i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had i known the language or rather languages which my fellowpassengers were speaking i might not have been able to throw them off so easily": 1667, "before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road": 1668, "there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals": 1669, "in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame": 1670, "the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste": 1671, "i could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund": 1672, "i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows": 1673, "in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order": 1674, "of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point": 1675, "beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves": 1676, "right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly": 1677, "here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water": 1678, "one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us look": 1679, "isten szek": 1680, "gods seat": 1681, "and he crossed himself reverently": 1682, "as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us": 1683, "this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink": 1684, "here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent": 1685, "by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves": 1686, "here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world": 1687, "there were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves": 1688, "now and again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith its long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road": 1689, "on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end": 1690, "as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow": 1691, "sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys": 1692, "sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses could only go slowly": 1693, "i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it": 1694, "no no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep": 1695, "the only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his lamps": 1696, "when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed": 1697, "he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions": 1698, "then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills": 1699, "the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea": 1700, "i had to hold on": 1701, "the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along": 1702, "then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass": 1703, "one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye": 1704, "then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness": 1705, "it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation": 1706, "this state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side": 1707, "there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder": 1708, "it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one": 1709, "i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count": 1710, "each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark": 1711, "the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud": 1712, "we could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle": 1713, "the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment": 1714, "i was already thinking what i had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i thought it was an hour less than the time": 1715, "then turning to me he said in german worse than my own there is no carriage here": 1716, "the herr is not expected after all": 1717, "he will now come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better the next day": 1718, "whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up": 1719, "then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a cal\u00e8che with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach": 1720, "i could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals": 1721, "they were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us": 1722, "i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us": 1723, "he said to the driver you are early tonight my friend": 1724, "the man stammered in reply the english herr was in a hurry to which the stranger replied that is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina": 1725, "you cannot deceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift": 1726, "as he spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth with very red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory": 1727, "one of my companions whispered to another the line from burgers lenore     denn die todten reiten schnell     for the dead travel fast": 1728, "the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile": 1729, "the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself": 1730, "give me the herrs luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the cal\u00e8che": 1731, "then i descended from the side of the coach as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been prodigious": 1732, "without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass": 1733, "as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves": 1734, "then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to bukovina": 1735, "as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in excellent german the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all care of you": 1736, "there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it": 1737, "i did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same": 1738, "i felt a little strangely and not a little frightened": 1739, "i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey": 1740, "the carriage went at a hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road": 1741, "it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was so": 1742, "i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay": 1743, "byandby however as i was curious to know how time was passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was within a few minutes of midnight": 1744, "this gave me a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences": 1745, "i waited with a sick feeling of suspense": 1746, "then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roada long agonised wailing as if from fear": 1747, "the sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night": 1748, "at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright": 1749, "then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich affected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor i was minded to jump from the cal\u00e8che and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting": 1750, "in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them": 1751, "he petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horsetamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled": 1752, "the driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace": 1753, "this time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right": 1754, "soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side": 1755, "though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along": 1756, "it grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket": 1757, "the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way": 1758, "the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side": 1759, "i grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear": 1760, "the driver however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness": 1761, "suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame": 1762, "the driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness": 1763, "i did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey": 1764, "i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare": 1765, "once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us i could watch the drivers motions": 1766, "he went rapidly to where the blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stones formed them into some device": 1767, "once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same": 1768, "this startled me but as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness": 1769, "then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle": 1770, "at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright": 1771, "i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light i saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair": 1772, "they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled": 1773, "for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear": 1774, "it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import": 1775, "all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them": 1776, "the horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it": 1777, "i called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach": 1778, "i shouted and beat the side of the cal\u00e8che hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap": 1779, "how he came there i know not but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway": 1780, "as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still": 1781, "just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness": 1782, "when i could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che and the wolves had disappeared": 1783, "this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move": 1784, "the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon": 1785, "we kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending": 1786, "suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky": 1787, "chapter ii jonathan harkers journalcontinued 5 mayi must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place": 1788, "in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is": 1789, "i have not yet been able to see it by daylight": 1790, "when the cal\u00e8che stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight": 1791, "again i could not but notice his prodigious strength": 1792, "his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen": 1793, "then he took out my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone": 1794, "i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather": 1795, "as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings": 1796, "i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do": 1797, "of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate": 1798, "the time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon me": 1799, "what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people": 1800, "what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked": 1801, "was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner": 1802, "solicitors clerk": 1803, "mina would not like that": 1804, "solicitorfor just before leaving london i got word that my examination was successful and i am now a fullblown solicitor": 1805, "i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake": 1806, "it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and i expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork": 1807, "but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived": 1808, "i was indeed awake and among the carpathians": 1809, "all i could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning": 1810, "just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light": 1811, "then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back": 1812, "a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back": 1813, "within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere": 1814, "he held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door": 1815, "the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation welcome to my house": 1816, "enter freely and of your own will": 1817, "he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone": 1818, "the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man": 1819, "again he said welcome to my house": 1820, "come freely": 1821, "go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring": 1822, "the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking so to make sure i said interrogatively count dracula": 1823, "he bowed in a courtly way as he replied i am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house": 1824, "come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest": 1825, "as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him": 1826, "i protested but he insisted nay sir you are my guest": 1827, "it is late and my people are not available": 1828, "let me see to your comfort myself": 1829, "he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily": 1830, "at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flamed and flared": 1831, "the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort": 1832, "passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter": 1833, "it was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log firealso added to but lately for the top logs were freshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney": 1834, "the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your toilet": 1835, "i trust you will find all you wish": 1836, "when you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared": 1837, "the light and warmth and the counts courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears": 1838, "having then reached my normal state i discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet i went into the other room": 1839, "i found supper already laid out": 1840, "my host who stood on one side of the great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave of his hand to the table and said i pray you be seated and sup how you please": 1841, "you will i trust excuse me that i do not join you but i have dined already and i do not sup": 1842, "i handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to me": 1843, "he opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed it to me to read": 1844, "one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure": 1845, "i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence": 1846, "he is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition": 1847, "he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service": 1848, "he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters": 1849, "the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken": 1850, "this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper": 1851, "during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced": 1852, "by this time i had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke": 1853, "i had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy": 1854, "his face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere": 1855, "his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion": 1856, "the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years": 1857, "for the rest his ears were pale and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm though thin": 1858, "the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor": 1859, "hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather coarsebroad with squat fingers": 1860, "strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm": 1861, "the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point": 1862, "as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not repress a shudder": 1863, "it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could not conceal": 1864, "the count evidently noticing it drew back and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace": 1865, "we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards the window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn": 1866, "there seemed a strange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves": 1867, "the counts eyes gleamed and he said listen to themthe children of the night": 1868, "what music they make": 1869, "seeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him he added ah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter": 1870, "then he rose and said but you must be tired": 1871, "your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will": 1872, "i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well": 1873, "with a courteous bow he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom i am all in a sea of wonders": 1874, "i doubt i fear i think strange things which i dare not confess to my own soul": 1875, "god keep me if only for the sake of those dear to me": 1876, "7 mayit is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twentyfour hours": 1877, "i slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord": 1878, "when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth": 1879, "there was a card on the table on which was written i have to be absent for a while": 1880, "do not wait for med": 1881, "i set to and enjoyed a hearty meal": 1882, "when i had done i looked for a bell so that i might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one": 1883, "there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me": 1884, "the table service is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value": 1885, "the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order": 1886, "i saw something like them in hampton court but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten": 1887, "but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror": 1888, "there is not even a toilet glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair": 1889, "i have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves": 1890, "some time after i had finished my meali do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when i had iti looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about the castle until i had asked the counts permission": 1891, "there was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of library": 1892, "the door opposite mine i tried but found it locked": 1893, "in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers": 1894, "a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date": 1895, "the books were of the most varied kindhistory geography politics political economy botany geology lawall relating to england and english life and customs and manners": 1896, "there were even such books of reference as the london directory the red and blue books whitakers almanac the army and navy lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthe law list": 1897, "whilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the count entered": 1898, "he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a good nights rest": 1899, "then he went on i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that will interest you": 1900, "these companionsand he laid his hand on some of the bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure": 1901, "through them i have come to know your great england and to know her is to love her": 1902, "i long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes it what it is": 1903, "but alas": 1904, "as yet i only know your tongue through books": 1905, "to you my friend i look that i know it to speak": 1906, "but count i said you know and speak english thoroughly": 1907, "he bowed gravely": 1908, "i thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet i fear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel": 1909, "true i know the grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak them": 1910, "indeed i said you speak excellently": 1911, "not so he answered": 1912, "well i know that did i move and speak in your london none there are who would not know me for a stranger": 1913, "that is not enough for me": 1914, "here i am noble i am boyar the common people know me and i am master": 1915, "but a stranger in a strange land he is no one men know him notand to know not is to care not for": 1916, "i am content if i am like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his speaking if he hear my words ha ha": 1917, "a stranger": 1918, "i have been so long master that i would be master stillor at least that none other should be master of me": 1919, "you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london": 1920, "you shall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i may learn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i make error even of the smallest in my speaking": 1921, "i am sorry that i had to be away so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand": 1922, "of course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i might come into that room when i chose": 1923, "he answered yes certainly and added you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go": 1924, "there is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand": 1925, "i said i was sure of this and then he went on we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england": 1926, "our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things": 1927, "nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be": 1928, "this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talkings sake i asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice": 1929, "sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked most frankly": 1930, "then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames": 1931, "he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed": 1932, "that treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the wallachian the saxon and the turk": 1933, "why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders": 1934, "in old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches": 1935, "when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil": 1936, "but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look": 1937, "the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool": 1938, "those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his doors": 1939, "and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do": 1940, "why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work": 1941, "even you would not i dare be sworn be able to find these places again": 1942, "there you are right i said": 1943, "i know no more than the dead where even to look for them": 1944, "then we drifted into other matters": 1945, "come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you have procured for me": 1946, "with an apology for my remissness i went into my own room to get the papers from my bag": 1947, "whilst i was placing them in order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark": 1948, "the lamps were also lit in the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaws guide": 1949, "when i came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts": 1950, "he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings": 1951, "he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than i did": 1952, "when i remarked this he answered well but my friend is it not needful that i should": 1953, "when i go there i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathannay pardon me i fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me": 1954, "he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins": 1955, "so": 1956, "we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet": 1957, "when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to mr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a place": 1958, "i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here at purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale": 1959, "it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years": 1960, "the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust": 1961, "the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass": 1962, "it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned": 1963, "there are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and flows away in a fairsized stream": 1964, "the house is very large and of all periods back i should say to medi\u00e6val times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron": 1965, "it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church": 1966, "i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points": 1967, "the house has been added to but in a very straggling way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great": 1968, "there are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum": 1969, "it is not however visible from the grounds": 1970, "when i had finished he said i am glad that it is old and big": 1971, "i myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me": 1972, "a house cannot be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century": 1973, "i rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times": 1974, "we transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead": 1975, "i seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay": 1976, "i am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth": 1977, "moreover the walls of my castle are broken the shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements": 1978, "i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when i may": 1979, "somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine": 1980, "presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers together": 1981, "he was some little time away and i began to look at some of the books around me": 1982, "one was an atlas which i found opened naturally at england as if that map had been much used": 1983, "on looking at it i found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast": 1984, "it was the better part of an hour when the count returned": 1985, "aha": 1986, "he said still at your books": 1987, "but you must not work always": 1988, "come i am informed that your supper is ready": 1989, "he took my arm and we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table": 1990, "the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home": 1991, "but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate": 1992, "after supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour": 1993, "i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in every way": 1994, "i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide": 1995, "they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it": 1996, "all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count dracula jumping to his feet said why there is the morning again": 1997, "how remiss i am to let you stay up so long": 1998, "you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me": 1999, "i went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the warm grey of quickening sky": 2000, "so i pulled the curtains again and have written of this day": 2001, "8 mayi began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too diffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i cannot but feel uneasy": 2002, "i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come": 2003, "it may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on me but would that that were all": 2004, "if there were any one to talk to i could bear it but there is no one": 2005, "i have only the count to speak with and hei fear i am myself the only living soul within the place": 2006, "let me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and imagination must not run riot with me": 2007, "if it does i am lost": 2008, "let me say at once how i standor seem to": 2009, "i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could not sleep any more got up": 2010, "i had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave": 2011, "suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the counts voice saying to me goodmorning": 2012, "i started for it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me": 2013, "in starting i had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment": 2014, "having answered the counts salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken": 2015, "this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i could see him over my shoulder": 2016, "but there was no reflection of him in the mirror": 2017, "the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself": 2018, "this was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but at the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin": 2019, "i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster": 2020, "when the count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat": 2021, "i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix": 2022, "it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there": 2023, "take care he said take care how you cut yourself": 2024, "it is more dangerous than you think in this country": 2025, "then seizing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief": 2026, "it is a foul bauble of mans vanity": 2027, "away with it": 2028, "and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below": 2029, "then he withdrew without a word": 2030, "it is very annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcase or the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metal": 2031, "when i went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere": 2032, "so i breakfasted alone": 2033, "it is strange that as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink": 2034, "he must be a very peculiar man": 2035, "after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle": 2036, "i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south": 2037, "the view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it": 2038, "the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice": 2039, "a stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything": 2040, "as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm": 2041, "here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests": 2042, "but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted": 2043, "in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit": 2044, "the castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisoner": 2045, "chapter iii jonathan harkers journalcontinued when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me": 2046, "i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings": 2047, "when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap": 2048, "when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietlyas quietly as i have ever done anything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done": 2049, "i am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion": 2050, "of one thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known to the count": 2051, "he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts": 2052, "so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open": 2053, "i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brains to get through": 2054, "i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned": 2055, "he did not come at once into the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed": 2056, "this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thoughtthat there were no servants in the house": 2057, "when later i saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the diningroom i was assured of it for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them": 2058, "this gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here": 2059, "this is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand in silence": 2060, "how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me": 2061, "what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash": 2062, "bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck": 2063, "for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it": 2064, "it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help": 2065, "is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort": 2066, "some time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it": 2067, "in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula as it may help me to understand": 2068, "tonight he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way": 2069, "i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion": 2070, "midnighti have had a long talk with the count": 2071, "i asked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully": 2072, "in his speaking of things and people and especially of battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all": 2073, "this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate": 2074, "whenever he spoke of his house he always said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking": 2075, "i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most fascinating": 2076, "it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country": 2077, "he grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength": 2078, "one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of his race we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship": 2079, "here in the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ay and of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come": 2080, "here too when they came they found the huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert": 2081, "fools fools": 2082, "what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila whose blood is in these veins": 2083, "he held up his arms": 2084, "is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back": 2085, "is it strange that when arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completed there": 2086, "and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkeyland ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say water sleeps and enemy is sleepless": 2087, "who more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king": 2088, "when was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent": 2089, "who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground": 2090, "this was a dracula indeed": 2091, "woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them": 2092, "was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkeyland who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph": 2093, "they said that he thought only of himself": 2094, "bah": 2095, "what good are peasants without a leader": 2096, "where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it": 2097, "again when after the battle of moh\u00e1cs we threw off the hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free": 2098, "ah young sir the szekelysand the dracula as their hearts blood their brains and their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach": 2099, "the warlike days are over": 2100, "blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told": 2101, "it was by this time close on morning and we went to bed": 2102, "mem this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamlets father": 2103, "12 maylet me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified by books and figures and of which there can be no doubt": 2104, "i must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of them": 2105, "last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business": 2106, "i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters i had been examined in at lincolns inn": 2107, "there was a certain method in the counts inquiries so i shall try to put them down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me": 2108, "first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more": 2109, "i told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest": 2110, "he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor": 2111, "i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said i shall illustrate": 2112, "your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buys for me through your good self my place at london": 2113, "now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest": 2114, "now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports": 2115, "i answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble": 2116, "but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself": 2117, "of course i replied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person": 2118, "he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against": 2119, "i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee": 2120, "for a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful": 2121, "when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said have you written since your first letter to our friend mr peter hawkins or to any other": 2122, "it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody": 2123, "then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now": 2124, "do you wish me to stay so long": 2125, "i asked for my heart grew cold at the thought": 2126, "i desire it much nay i will take no refusal": 2127, "when your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted": 2128, "i have not stinted": 2129, "what could i do but bow acceptance": 2130, "it was mr hawkinss interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i could have no choice": 2131, "the count saw his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless way i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters": 2132, "it will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them": 2133, "as he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes": 2134, "they were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understood as well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote for he would be able to read it": 2135, "so i determined to write only formal notes now but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina for to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it": 2136, "when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table": 2137, "then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table": 2138, "i felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way i could": 2139, "one of the letters was directed to samuel f billington no": 2140, "7 the crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was to coutts  co london and the fourth to herren klopstock  billreuth bankers budapesth": 2141, "the second and fourth were unsealed": 2142, "i was just about to look at them when i saw the doorhandle move": 2143, "i sank back in my seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room": 2144, "he took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning to me said i trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this evening": 2145, "you will i hope find all things as you wish": 2146, "at the door he turned and after a moments pause said let me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle": 2147, "it is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely": 2148, "be warned": 2149, "should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe": 2150, "but if you be not careful in this respect thenhe finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them": 2151, "i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me": 2152, "lateri endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question": 2153, "i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not": 2154, "i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain": 2155, "when he left me i went to my room": 2156, "after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out towards the south": 2157, "there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard": 2158, "looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night": 2159, "i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me": 2160, "it is destroying my nerve": 2161, "i start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings": 2162, "god knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place": 2163, "i looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day": 2164, "in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness": 2165, "the mere beauty seemed to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew": 2166, "as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the counts own room would look out": 2167, "the window at which i stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and though weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there": 2168, "i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out": 2169, "what i saw was the counts head coming out from the window": 2170, "i did not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms": 2171, "in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had so many opportunities of studying": 2172, "i was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner": 2173, "but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings": 2174, "at first i could not believe my eyes": 2175, "i thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be no delusion": 2176, "i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall": 2177, "what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man": 2178, "i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me i am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me i am encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of                                         15 mayonce more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion": 2179, "he moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left": 2180, "he vanished into some hole or window": 2181, "when his head had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without availthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight": 2182, "i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet": 2183, "i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors": 2184, "they were all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally": 2185, "i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked and the key was gone": 2186, "that key must be in the counts room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape": 2187, "i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them": 2188, "one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten": 2189, "at last however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure": 2190, "i tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor": 2191, "here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter": 2192, "i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down": 2193, "from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south": 2194, "on the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice": 2195, "the castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured": 2196, "to the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone": 2197, "this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of comfort than any i had seen": 2198, "the windows were curtainless and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth": 2199, "my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble": 2200, "still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i found a soft quietude come over me": 2201, "here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last": 2202, "it is nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance": 2203, "and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill": 2204, "later the morning of 16 maygod preserve my sanity for to this i am reduced": 2205, "safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past": 2206, "whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not mad already": 2207, "if i be sane then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose": 2208, "great god": 2209, "merciful god": 2210, "let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed": 2211, "i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me": 2212, "up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say     my tablets": 2213, "quick my tablets": 2214, "tis meet that i put it down etc for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose": 2215, "the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me": 2216, "the counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightens me more now when i think of it for in future he has a fearful hold upon me": 2217, "i shall fear to doubt what he may say": 2218, "when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket i felt sleepy": 2219, "the counts warning came into my mind but i took a pleasure in disobeying it": 2220, "the sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider": 2221, "the soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me": 2222, "i determined not to return tonight to the gloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars": 2223, "i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep": 2224, "i suppose i must have fallen asleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlingly realso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep": 2225, "i was not alone": 2226, "the room was the same unchanged in any way since i came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust": 2227, "in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner": 2228, "i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw no shadow on the floor": 2229, "they came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together": 2230, "two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon": 2231, "the other was fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires": 2232, "i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where": 2233, "all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips": 2234, "there was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear": 2235, "i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips": 2236, "it is not good to note this down lest some day it should meet minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth": 2237, "they whispered together and then they all three laughedsuch a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips": 2238, "it was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand": 2239, "the fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her on": 2240, "one said go on": 2241, "you are first and we shall follow yours is the right to begin": 2242, "the other added he is young and strong there are kisses for us all": 2243, "i lay quiet looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation": 2244, "the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement of her breath upon me": 2245, "sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood": 2246, "i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes": 2247, "the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating": 2248, "there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth": 2249, "lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat": 2250, "then she paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck": 2251, "then the skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearernearer": 2252, "i could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there": 2253, "i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating heart": 2254, "but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning": 2255, "i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury": 2256, "as my eyes opened involuntarily i saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion": 2257, "but the count": 2258, "never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit": 2259, "his eyes were positively blazing": 2260, "the red light in them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them": 2261, "his face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal": 2262, "with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves": 2263, "in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said how dare you touch him any of you": 2264, "how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it": 2265, "back i tell you all": 2266, "this man belongs to me": 2267, "beware how you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me": 2268, "the fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him you yourself never loved you never love": 2269, "on this the other women joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure of fiends": 2270, "then the count turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past": 2271, "well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall kiss him at your will": 2272, "now go": 2273, "go": 2274, "i must awaken him for there is work to be done": 2275, "are we to have nothing tonight": 2276, "said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living thing within it": 2277, "for answer he nodded his head": 2278, "one of the women jumped forward and opened it": 2279, "if my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a halfsmothered child": 2280, "the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag": 2281, "there was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing": 2282, "they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away": 2283, "then the horror overcame me and i sank down unconscious": 2284, "chapter iv jonathan harkers journalcontinued i awoke in my own bed": 2285, "if it be that i had not dreamt the count must have carried me here": 2286, "i tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result": 2287, "to be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit": 2288, "my watch was still unwound and i am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed and many such details": 2289, "but these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause or another i had certainly been much upset": 2290, "i must watch for proof": 2291, "of one thing i am glad if it was that the count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact": 2292, "i am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked": 2293, "he would have taken or destroyed it": 2294, "as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who werewho arewaiting to suck my blood": 2295, "18 mayi have been down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth": 2296, "when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs i found it closed": 2297, "it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered": 2298, "i could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside": 2299, "i fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise": 2300, "19 mayi am surely in the toils": 2301, "last night the count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that i should start for home within a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at bistritz": 2302, "i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger": 2303, "he knows that i know too much and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to him my only chance is to prolong my opportunities": 2304, "something may occur which will give me a chance to escape": 2305, "i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him": 2306, "he explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which would be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion": 2307, "i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates i should put on the letters": 2308, "he calculated a minute and then said the first should be june 12 the second june 19 and the third june 29": 2309, "i know now the span of my life": 2310, "god help me": 2311, "28 maythere is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able to send word home": 2312, "a band of szgany have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard": 2313, "these szgany are gipsies i have notes of them in my book": 2314, "they are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over": 2315, "there are thousands of them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all law": 2316, "they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name": 2317, "they are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romany tongue": 2318, "i shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted": 2319, "i have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship": 2320, "they took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however i could not understand any more than i could their spoken language                                         i have written the letters": 2321, "minas is in shorthand and i simply ask mr hawkins to communicate with her": 2322, "to her i have explained my situation but without the horrors which i may only surmise": 2323, "it would shock and frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her": 2324, "should the letters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge                                         i have given the letters i threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece and made what signs i could to have them posted": 2325, "the man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap": 2326, "i could do no more": 2327, "i stole back to the study and began to read": 2328, "as the count did not come in i have written here                                         the count has come": 2329, "he sat down beside me and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters the szgany has given me these of which though i know not whence they come i shall of course take care": 2330, "see": 2331, "he must have looked at itone is from you and to my friend peter hawkins the otherhere he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedlythe other is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality": 2332, "it is not signed": 2333, "so it cannot matter to us": 2334, "and he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed": 2335, "then he went on the letter to hawkinsthat i shall of course send on since it is yours": 2336, "your letters are sacred to me": 2337, "your pardon my friend that unknowingly i did break the seal": 2338, "will you not cover it again": 2339, "he held out the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope": 2340, "i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence": 2341, "when he went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly": 2342, "a minute later i went over and tried it and the door was locked": 2343, "when an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa": 2344, "he was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had been sleeping he said so my friend you are tired": 2345, "get to bed": 2346, "there is the surest rest": 2347, "i may not have the pleasure to talk tonight since there are many labours to me but you will sleep i pray": 2348, "i passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming": 2349, "despair has its own calms": 2350, "31 maythis morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock": 2351, "every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to me were i once outside the castle": 2352, "i sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes": 2353, "the suit in which i had travelled was gone and also my overcoat and rug i could find no trace of them anywhere": 2354, "this looked like some new scheme of villainy                                         17 junethis morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains i heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard": 2355, "with joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two great leiterwagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wide hat great nailstudded belt dirty sheepskin and high boots": 2356, "they had also their long staves in hand": 2357, "i ran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as i thought that way might be opened for them": 2358, "again a shock my door was fastened on the outside": 2359, "then i ran to the window and cried to them": 2360, "they looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the szgany came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed": 2361, "henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make them even look at me": 2362, "they resolutely turned away": 2363, "the leiterwagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved": 2364, "when they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks were given some money by the szgany and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horses head": 2365, "shortly afterwards i heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance": 2366, "24 june before morninglast night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room": 2367, "as soon as i dared i ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south": 2368, "i thought i would watch for the count for there is something going on": 2369, "the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind": 2370, "i know it for now and then i hear a faraway muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy": 2371, "i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the counts window": 2372, "i drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge": 2373, "it was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women take away": 2374, "there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too": 2375, "this then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me": 2376, "it makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst i am shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminals right and consolation": 2377, "i thought i would watch for the counts return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window": 2378, "then i began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight": 2379, "they were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way": 2380, "i watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me": 2381, "i leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the a\u00ebrial gambolling": 2382, "something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight": 2383, "louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight": 2384, "i felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was struggling and my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call": 2385, "i was becoming hypnotised": 2386, "quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond": 2387, "more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes": 2388, "and then i started broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place": 2389, "the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom i was doomed": 2390, "i fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly": 2391, "when a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the counts room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence deep awful silence which chilled me": 2392, "with a beating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison and could do nothing": 2393, "i sat down and simply cried": 2394, "as i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard withoutthe agonised cry of a woman": 2395, "i rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out between the bars": 2396, "there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running": 2397, "she was leaning against a corner of the gateway": 2398, "when she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace monster give me my child": 2399, "she threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart": 2400, "then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion": 2401, "finally she threw herself forward and though i could not see her i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door": 2402, "somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of the count calling in his harsh metallic whisper": 2403, "his call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves": 2404, "before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured like a pentup dam when liberated through the wide entrance into the courtyard": 2405, "there was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was but short": 2406, "before long they streamed away singly licking their lips": 2407, "i could not pity her for i knew now what had become of her child and she was better dead": 2408, "what shall i do": 2409, "what can i do": 2410, "how can i escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear": 2411, "25 june morningno man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be": 2412, "when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there": 2413, "my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth": 2414, "i must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me": 2415, "last night one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth": 2416, "let me not think of it": 2417, "action": 2418, "it has always been at nighttime that i have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear": 2419, "i have not yet seen the count in the daylight": 2420, "can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep": 2421, "if i could

may not another body go": 2426, "i have seen him myself crawl from his window": 2427, "why should not i imitate him and go in by his window": 2428, "the chances are desperate but my need is more desperate still": 2429, "i shall risk it": 2430, "at the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not a calfs and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me": 2431, "god help me in my task": 2432, "goodbye mina if i fail goodbye my faithful friend and second father goodbye all and last of all mina": 2433, "same day lateri have made the effort and god helping me have come safely back to this room": 2434, "i must put down every detail in order": 2435, "i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side": 2436, "the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them": 2437, "i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way": 2438, "i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it": 2439, "i knew pretty well the direction and distance of the counts window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available": 2440, "i did not feel dizzyi suppose i was too excitedand the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash": 2441, "i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window": 2442, "then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery": 2443, "the room was empty": 2444, "it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust": 2445, "i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere": 2446, "the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one cornergold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground": 2447, "none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old": 2448, "there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained": 2449, "at one corner of the room was a heavy door": 2450, "i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain": 2451, "it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down": 2452, "i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry": 2453, "at the bottom there was a dark tunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned": 2454, "as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier": 2455, "at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard": 2456, "the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks": 2457, "there was nobody about and i made search for any further outlet but there was none": 2458, "then i went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance": 2459, "i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul": 2460, "into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made a discovery": 2461, "there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count": 2462, "he was either dead or asleep i could not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever": 2463, "but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart": 2464, "i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain": 2465, "he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours": 2466, "by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there": 2467, "i thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the counts room by the window crawled again up the castle wall": 2468, "regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think                                         29 junetoday is the date of my last letter and the count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes": 2469, "as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand would have any effect on him": 2470, "i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters": 2471, "i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep": 2472, "i was awakened by the count who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said tomorrow my friend we must part": 2473, "you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet": 2474, "your letter home has been despatched tomorrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey": 2475, "in the morning come the szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovaks": 2476, "when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz": 2477, "but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula": 2478, "i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity": 2479, "sincerity": 2480, "it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him pointblank why may i not go tonight": 2481, "because dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a mission": 2482, "but i would walk with pleasure": 2483, "i want to get away at once": 2484, "he smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness": 2485, "he said and your baggage": 2486, "i do not care about it": 2487, "i can send for it some other time": 2488, "the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars welcome the coming speed the parting guest": 2489, "come with me my dear young friend": 2490, "not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it": 2491, "with a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall": 2492, "suddenly he stopped": 2493, "close at hand came the howling of many wolves": 2494, "it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the b\u00e2ton of the conductor": 2495, "after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open": 2496, "to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked": 2497, "suspiciously i looked all round but could see no key of any kind": 2498, "as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door": 2499, "i knew then that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless": 2500, "with such allies as these at his command i could do nothing": 2501, "but still the door continued slowly to open and only the counts body stood in the gap": 2502, "suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation": 2503, "there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cried out shut the door i shall wait till morning": 2504, "and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment": 2505, "with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places": 2506, "in silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i went to my own room": 2507, "the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of": 2508, "when i was in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard a whispering at my door": 2509, "i went to it softly and listened": 2510, "unless my ears deceived me i heard the voice of the count back back to your own place": 2511, "your time is not yet come": 2512, "wait": 2513, "have patience": 2514, "tonight is mine": 2515, "tomorrow night is yours": 2516, "there was a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips": 2517, "as i appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away": 2518, "i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees": 2519, "it is then so near the end": 2520, "lord help me and those to whom i am dear": 2521, "30 june morningthese may be the last words i ever write in this diary": 2522, "i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready": 2523, "at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come": 2524, "then came the welcome cockcrow and i felt that i was safe": 2525, "with a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall": 2526, "i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me": 2527, "with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts": 2528, "but the door would not move": 2529, "despair seized me": 2530, "i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement": 2531, "i could see the bolt shot": 2532, "it had been locked after i left the count": 2533, "then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the counts room": 2534, "he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils": 2535, "without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the counts room": 2536, "it was empty but that was as i expected": 2537, "i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained": 2538, "i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel": 2539, "i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought": 2540, "the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home": 2541, "i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror": 2542, "there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck": 2543, "even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated": 2544, "it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood": 2545, "he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion": 2546, "i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost": 2547, "the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three": 2548, "i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key": 2549, "then i stopped and looked at the count": 2550, "there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad": 2551, "this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless": 2552, "the very thought drove me mad": 2553, "a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster": 2554, "there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face": 2555, "but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror": 2556, "the sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead": 2557, "the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight": 2558, "the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell": 2559, "i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me": 2560, "as i waited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming": 2561, "with a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body i ran from the place and gained the counts room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened": 2562, "with strained ears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door": 2563, "there must have been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one of the locked doors": 2564, "then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo": 2565, "i turned to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying": 2566, "when i ran to push it open i found that it was hopelessly fast": 2567, "i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely": 2568, "as i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth": 2569, "there is a sound of hammering it is the box being nailed down": 2570, "now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them": 2571, "the door is shut and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the key in the lock i can hear the key withdraw then another door opens and shuts i hear the creaking of lock and bolt": 2572, "in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels the crack of whips and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the distance": 2573, "i am alone in the castle with those awful women": 2574, "faugh": 2575, "mina is a woman and there is nought in common": 2576, "they are devils of the pit": 2577, "i shall not remain alone with them i shall try to scale the castle wall farther than i have yet attempted": 2578, "i shall take some of the gold with me lest i want it later": 2579, "i may find a way from this dreadful place": 2580, "and then away for home": 2581, "away to the quickest and nearest train": 2582, "away from this cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet": 2583, "at least gods mercy is better than that of these monsters and the precipice is steep and high": 2584, "at its foot a man may sleepas a man": 2585, "goodbye all": 2586,
